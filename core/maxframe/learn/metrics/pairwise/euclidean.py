):
    """
    Considering the rows of X (and Y=X) as vectors, compute the
    distance matrix between each pair of vectors.

    For efficiency reasons, the euclidean distance between a pair of row
    vector x and y is computed as::

        dist(x, y) = sqrt(dot(x, x) - 2 * dot(x, y) + dot(y, y))

    This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing distances.
    First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with sparse data.
    Second, if one argument varies but the other remains unchanged, then
    `dot(x, x)` and/or `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed.

    However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation, and
    the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly
    symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_1, n_features)

    Y : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n_samples_2, n_features)

    Y_norm_squared : array-like, shape (n_samples_2, ), optional
        Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in Y (e.g.,
        ``(Y**2).sum(axis=1)``)
        May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.

    squared : boolean, optional
        Return squared Euclidean distances.

    X_norm_squared : array-like, shape = [n_samples_1], optional
        Pre-computed dot-products of vectors in X (e.g.,
        ``(X**2).sum(axis=1)``)
        May be ignored in some cases, see the note below.

    Notes
    -----
    To achieve better accuracy, `X_norm_squared`Â and `Y_norm_squared` may be
    unused if they are passed as ``float32``.

    Returns
    -------
    distances : tensor, shape (n_samples_1, n_samples_2)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from maxframe.learn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances
    >>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> # distance between rows of X
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, X).execute()
    array([[0., 1.],
           [1., 0.]])
    >>> # get distance to origin
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, [[0, 0]]).execute()
    array([[1.        ],
           [1.41421356]])
